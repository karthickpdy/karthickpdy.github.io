<p>Hi, I am a software developer who believes in clean code, scalable and simple architecture, constant learning and improvement.</p>
<p> I am currently working as backend developer at Amazon solving challenging business and scalability problems in distributed systems. </p>
<p>I am extremely passionate about coding and love to try out new technologies. I have experience with a wide variety of technologies like AWS, Java, Chatbots, Alexa skill and Blockchain.</p>
<p>I strongly believe knowledge compounds incrementally day by day. The blog is named after <b>Kaizen</b> - a Japanese philosphy which states that small, ongoing positive changes can reap major improvements</p>
<p>I also teach and mentor developers in various technologies. I teach algorithms and DS for technical interviews and also conduct mock interviews for aspiring candidates looking to clear top companies. Feel free to <a href="{{site.url}}/contact"> reach out </a> to me for any of these services or just to catchup for a coffee :).</p>
